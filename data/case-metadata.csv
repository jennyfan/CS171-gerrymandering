6/30/1986,Davis v. Bandemer,"Davis v. Bandemer,�478�U.S.�109 (1986), is a case in which the�United States Supreme Court�held that claims of partisan�gerrymandering�were�justiciable, but failed to agree on a clear standard for the judicial review of the class of claims of a political nature to which such cases belong. The decision was later limited with respect to many of the elements directly involving issues of�redistricting�and political gerrymandering, but was somewhat broadened with respect to less significant ancillary procedural issues.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_v._Bandemer

The ruling was significant in the area of partisan�redistricting�and political�gerrymandering. The court, in a plurality decision by Justice�Antonin Scalia�and joined by Chief Justice�William Rehnquist�and Justices�Sandra Day O'Connor�and�Clarence Thomas, with Justice�Anthony Kennedy�concurring in the judgment, upheld the ruling of the District Court in favor of the appellees that the alleged political gerrymandering was not unconstitutional.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer
10/3/2017,Gill v. Whitford,"In 2010, for the first time in over forty years, Wisconsin voters elected a Republican majority in the state assembly and the senate, and a Republican governor. As a result, the Republican leadership developed a voting district map that its drafters calculated would allow Republicans to maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario. The redistricting plan was introduced in July 2011, and both the senate and the assembly passed the bill shortly thereafter. The governor signed the bill into law in August 2011. Even before it was enacted, the plan faced two legal challenges, on constitutional and statutory grounds. A federal court upheld the plan as not violating the �one person one vote� principle nor violating the Equal Protection Clause.",https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1161
6/18/1973,Gaffney v. Cummings,"Gaffney v. Cummings�(412 U.S. 735 (1973)) is a�Supreme Court�decision upholding statewide legislative apportionment plans for Connecticut. The Court admitted that these plans entailed ""substantial inequalities in the population of the representative districts."" It observed that ""the States have made virtually no attempt to justify their failure 'to construct districts ... as nearly of equal population as is practicable."" It was a Fourteenth Amendment case. At issue was whether the election districts had been gerrymandered in violation of the�Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaffney_v._Cummings

Carr,�369�U.S.�186�(1962), was a�landmark�United States Supreme Court�case that decided that�redistricting�(attempts to change the way voting districts are delineated) issues present�justiciable�questions, thus enabling federal courts to intervene in and to decide redistricting cases. The defendants unsuccessfully argued that redistricting of legislative districts is a ""political question"", and hence not a question that may be resolved by federal courts.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Carr

6/15/1964,Reynolds v. Simms,"Reynolds v. Sims,�377�U.S.�533�(1964) was a�United States Supreme Court�case that ruled that unlike in the election of the�United States Senate, in the election of�any�chamber of a�state legislature�the electoral districts must be roughly equal in population (thus negating the traditional function of a State Senate, which was to allow rural counties to counterbalance large towns and cities). The case was brought on behalf of voters in Alabama by M.O. Sims, a taxpayer in�Birmingham, Alabama, but affected both northern and southern states that had similarly failed to reapportion their legislatures in keeping with changes in state population after its application in five companion cases in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims

Bossier Parish School Board,"Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act on 1995 prohibits Bossier Parish, Louisiana from enacting any change in a ""voting qualification[,] prerequisite[,] standard, practice, or procedure"" without first obtaining preclearance from either the Attorney General or the District Court. Following the 1990 census, the District Court granted Bossier Parish preclearance to redistrict. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U.S. 471, vacated the court's judgment and remanded for the court to question whether the section 5 purpose inquiry ever extends beyond the search for retrogressive intent. The District Court again granted preclearance. The court found that there was no evidence of discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose. The court left open the question of whether section 5 prohibits preclearance of a plan enacted with such a purpose.",https://www.oyez.org/cases/1998/98-405
6/26/2003,Georgia v. Ashcroft,"Georgia v. Ashcroft,�539�U.S.�461 (2003), is a�United States Supreme Court�case in which the Court found that a three-judge federal district court panel did not consider all of the requisite relevant factors when it examined whether the 2001�Georgia State Senate�redistricting�plan resulted in retrogression of black voters� effective exercise of the electoral franchise in contravention of Section 5 of the�Voting Rights Act. Section 5, which only applies to those states or political subdivisions that are considered �covered� under Section 4(b) of the VRA, requires that before any change in voting procedure can take effect, it must be precleared by the federal government by a demonstration that the change would not ""lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.� The Court held that the district court analysis was incorrect �because it focused too heavily on the ability of the minority group to elect a candidate of its choice in the [safe] districts,� without giving proper consideration to other factors such as the state�s creation of additional influence and coalition districts. Accordingly, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case to the district court to examine the facts using the new standard announced in its opinion.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_v._Ashcroft

Flores,"The Archbishop of San Antonio sued local zoning authorities for violating his rights under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), by denying him a permit to expand his church in Boerne, Texas. Boerne's zoning authorities argued that the Archbishop's church was located in a historic preservation district governed by an ordinance forbidding new construction, and that the RFRA was unconstitutional insofar as it sought to override this local preservation ordinance. On appeal from the Fifth Circuit's reversal of a District Court's finding against Archbishop Flores, the Court granted Boerne's request for certiorari.",https://www.oyez.org/cases/1996/95-2074

Carr,1 which interpreted the 14th Amendment�s Equal Protection Clause to require that political districts be equal in population so that one person�s vote would not weigh more than a another person�s vote who resides in separate a district with substantially less population than the first. For example, a voter in a political district with 100,000 residents will have 3 times more voting power to elect a representative than a voter in a district with 300,000 residents.

On March 3, the Attorney General, after citing the combination,�inter alia,�of multi-member districts, majority runoff elections, and numbered posts, objected to the plan, being unable to conclude that it did not have a discriminatory racial effect on voting. The state legislature then enacted its superseding 1972 plan, which was submitted on March 15 and rejected by the Attorney General on March 24 as not overcoming previous objections.

Monterey County,"ecause Monterey County, California is a jurisdiction covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it must obtain federal preclearance of any voting practice different from its practices on November 1, 1968.
