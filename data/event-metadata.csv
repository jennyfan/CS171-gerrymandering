3/26/1812,"""The Gerry-mander"" first appeared in this cartoon-map in the Boston Gazette, 26 March 1812.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States,"Gerrymandering first entered the American vernacular in 1812 when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry, a signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation (he refused to sign the U.S. Constitution), signed a redistricting bill into law that benefitted his party over the Federalists, who held a majority among voters in the Commonwealth. The response was resoundingly negative:  A new species of Monster, which appeared in Essex South District in Jan. 1812,  blared an anonymous broadside printed in The Boston Gazette on March 26, 1812. The drawing represented the Essex South state senatorial district for the Massachusetts legislature, which had been drawn to not only resemble a salamander, but also to benefit the Democratic-Republican party in the state. Although the practice of drawing legislative boundaries for political benefit existed in 18th century American politics, the origin of the term  gerrymander  made its debut in this article.",https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/07/06/a-primer-on-gerrymandering-and-political-polarization/,

The first known use outside the immediate Boston area came in the Newburyport Herald of Massachusetts on 31 March, and the first known use outside Massachusetts came in the Concord Gazette of New Hampshire on 14 April 1812. The first known use outside New England came in the New York Gazette & General Advertiser on 19 May. What may be the first use of the term to describe the redistricting in another state (Maryland) occurred in the Federal Republican (Georgetown, Washington, DC) on 12 October 1812. There are at least 80 known citations of the word from March through December 1812 in American newspapers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newburyport_Herald,

Mascara was elected to Congress in 1994. In 2002, the Republican Party altered the boundaries of his original district so much that he was pitted against fellow Democratic candidate John Murtha in the election. The shape of Mascara's newly drawn district formed a finger that stopped at his street, encompassing his house, but not the spot where he parked his car. Murtha won the election in the newly formed district.",http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/electionInfo/index.aspx,

12/8/2003,The Great Election Grab, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/12/08/the-great-election-grab,"In Texas and elsewhere, redistricting has transformed American politics. The framers of the Constitution created the House of Representatives to be the branch of government most responsive to changes in the public mood, but gerrymandered districts mean that most of the four hundred and thirty-five members of Congress never face seriously contested general elections. In 2002, eighty-one incumbents ran unopposed by a major party candidate. "There are now about four hundred safe seats in Congress," Richard Pildes, a professor of law at New York University, said. "The level of competitiveness has plummeted to the point where it is hard to describe the House as involving competitive elections at all these days." The House isn’t just ossified; it’s polarized, too. Members of the House now effectively answer only to primary voters, who represent the extreme partisan edge of both parties. As a result, collaboration and compromise between the parties have almost disappeared. The Republican advantage in the House is modest—just two hundred and twenty-nine seats to two hundred and six—but gerrymandering has made the lead close to insurmountable for the foreseeable future.",https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/12/08/the-great-election-grab

' The situtation is especially ironic because racial integration of the nation's housing market long has been a high-priority goal of virtually every responsible political leader who is a member of a minority group. Blacks and Hispanics able to flee from the blighted cores of many of the country's biggest cities, they have argued, oftwe can benefit from the superior vocational, educational and recreational opportunities in the booming suburbs.- But the departure of those minority-group voters from the cities has endangered the status of approximately a dozen House members and scores of , state legislators who no longer can rely upon a solii political base of ethnic support",https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/154867127/
