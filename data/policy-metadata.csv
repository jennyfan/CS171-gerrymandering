7/9/1868,14th Amendment,"Redistricting became mandatory as a matter of federal law after the 1962 Supreme Court decision in Baker v. Carr,1 which interpreted the 14th Amendment s Equal Protection Clause to require that political districts be equal in population so that one person s vote would not weigh more than a another person s vote who resides in separate a district with substantially less population than the first. For example, a voter in a political district with 100,000 residents will have 3 times more voting power to elect a representative than a voter in a district with 300,000 residents. The court s ruling is known as the  one man, one vote principle."" ",http://www.redistrictingonline.org/redistrictingprinciples.html
9/17/1787,"Article 1, Sec 2 of the U.S. Constitution",The census clause of the U.S. Constitution requires an actual enumeration of the country s population on a decennial basis for purposes of congressional reapportionment of seats among the states. The Supreme Court held in 19992 that reapportionment must be carried out using the Census Bureau s actual enumeration and not the statistically adjusted data that it also obtains. Whether or not this also applies to redistricting is still an open question but the Census Bureau and states have so far used the census actual enumeration data for redistricting purposes.  ,http://www.redistrictingonline.org/redistrictingprinciples.html
