			<h2>A Tradition as Old as the Republic</h2>
			<p>Gerrymandering, or the practice of manipulating electoral district boundaries for political gain, is a practice as old as America itself.</p>

			<p>Where the lines are drawn affects both state and federal elections. For Congressional elections, states are divided into districts based on how many representatives they send to the House of Representatives. In these cases, partisan gerrymandering is often used to maximize the wins for their own party.</p>

			<p>Many of the resulting districts end up as <a href="#">strange, winding shapes</a> that intentionally include or exclude populations for political gain.</p>

			<p>As a result, even though Party A may win the popular vote, Party B may end up sending more representatives to congress. Whoever decides the lines decide whose vote is reflected. This can skew statewide representation, dilute minority votes, split communities.</p>

			<h2>Who draws the lines?</h2>
			<p>District lines are redrawn every 10 years to reflect the updated populations taken by the US Census.</p>

			<p>In most states, district lines are drawn by the majority party of the state legislature and approved by governor. Even in states with alternative processes like Independent Commissions, there are seats specifically reserved for Democratic or Republican appointees, so there are no truly non-partisan redistricting committees.</p>

			<h2>The Art &amp; Science of Map Manipulation</h2>

			<p>The goal of gerrymandering is to maximize the number of districts that will vote for your party. There are multiple ways to do that, primarily being <b>“cracking”</b> the constituency to dilute votes and <b>"packing"</b> similar interests to waste votes.</p>

			<p>Ideally, a district map would place all of your opponent’s supporters into only a few foregone districts, while the rest of your supporters can be spread out evenly amongst the districts so you win a comfortable majority.</p>

			<p>This partisan distribution requires balancing the risk of maintaining a comfortable lead with the need of minimizing vote wastage.</p>

			<h2>Unfair Divisions</h2>

			<p>Gerrymandering often occurs to secure party control, favor incumbents, or dilute the voting power of certain demographic groups.</p>

			<p>In some cases, gerrymandering <em>can</em> be helpful by grouping minority interests to give their community a voice in government. But there is a fine line between packing and cracking where an appropriate amount of community representation falls. The ambiguity of the situation is exacerbated by the lack of standard measurements of fairness.</p>

			<p>In an imaginary country of 50 people where 60% are blue and 40% are red, there are 3 ways to divide 5 districts.</p>

			<p>1. Perfect representation (3 blue districts, 2 red): Blue</p>
			<p>2. Compact but unfair (5 blue districts, 0 red): Blue</p>
			<p>3. Neither compact nor unfair (2 blue districts, 3 red): Red</p>

			<h2>A Rule for Fairness</h2>

			<p>To measure "fairness", numerous metrics have been proposed, including a measure of <b>compactness</b> (the ratio of perimeter to area, with the ideal being a perfect circle at 1) and more recently, the <b>efficiency gap</b>, which measures the number of both wasted vote and diluted votes.</p>

			<p>The efficiency gap measures a ratio of <b>net wasted votes</b> by both parties over the total number of votes cast. The metric is compared against the number of seats won to find any <b>seat advantages</b> attained by either party.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/whitford-v-gill" target="_blank">Gill v. Whitford</a> case heard by the Supreme Court in October 2017 offers an opportunity to set a precedent for a legal test of fairness.</p>
